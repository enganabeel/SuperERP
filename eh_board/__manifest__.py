    "description": """Dashboard Builder is a live business intelligence workspace for Odoo, not a chart arranger. Build a dashboard by dragging tiles onto a snapping grid, group any model's data database side, and click through to the records behind any figure - every number respects your record rules and multi-company access.

The engine is built from the ground up in OWL with original SVG charts, so there is no third party charting bundle to license and nothing loads from an external CDN. Every chart figure is produced with a grouped database read pushed to the database (a KPI tile adds a small trend read), so a board over a million-row ledger opens as fast as one over a handful of records.

This is one module. Everything is included:

- Over 20 original chart, KPI, gauge, table and content item types, plus a pivot / cross-tab matrix with subtotals, a real world choropleth map, and combo charts that draw one measure as bars and another as a line on its own second axis.
- Data from any Odoo model, two models joined on a shared key, an uploaded CSV or Excel file charted by its columns, or a locked-down read-only SQL provider (forced SELECT, keyword whitelist, statement timeout and rollback) with an admin-only credential vault. Calculated (formula) measures without a line of SQL.
- A real drag, resize and compaction grid with per-company layout variants, comfortable / compact density, and a responsive mobile stack.
- A global filter bar with relative-date presets, cross-filter (click any chart to re-scope the whole board) and multi-level drill-down with a breadcrumb.
- Snapshot history so a KPI trends on recorded values, threshold alerts that re-arm on each crossing, an emailed PDF digest, and offline smart insights that read the board in plain language.
- An optional bring-your-own-key AI: it rewrites the board's already-computed insight text into a short narrative using your own OpenAI or Anthropic key, off by default, calling your endpoint directly. Only the computed insight sentences (figures and group labels) are sent, never raw record rows, credentials, SQL or your database name.
- Ready-made vertical dashboards (Contacts, CRM and Sales, Accounting, Warehouse, Point of Sale, HR) that install from a gallery and stay inert until their base app is present, plus save-any-board-as-a-template.
- Per-dashboard sharing and access control, chart palettes, a full-screen presentation and kiosk mode with auto-rotation, a genuine app-level dark and light theme, and vector PDF, Excel, CSV, PNG and JSON export.
- First-class accessibility: keyboard operation and a screen-reader data table behind every chart, a right-to-left aware layout, and an interface translated across nineteen languages.
